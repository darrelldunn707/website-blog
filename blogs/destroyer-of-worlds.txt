alcohol. the destroyer of worlds.

destroyer of energy
          of sleep
          of rest

destroyer of health
         of vitality

destroyer of relationships
          of connection

destroyer of my life

i drink when i am sad
        when i am lonely
        when i hurt

i drink when i lose money

i drink when i am excited
        working on business idea
        working on a new app idea

i drink to get away
        to escape
        to comfort
        to sooth

i drink no more.

i am the creator of my life...
